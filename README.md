# Chitrakoot-Geological-Field-Study-Vindhyan-Basin

# Project Overview:

This repository presents the complete geological field report from a detailed field excursion across the Chitrakoot region, situated along the northern margin of the Vindhyan Basin. The purpose of the study was to examine how the ancient Bundelkhand Granitic Complex interacts with the overlying sedimentary formations of the Vindhyan Supergroup, while also understanding the geomorphological and structural processes that shaped the area. The field trip covered a wide variety of terrains—granite cliffs along the Ken River, limestone passages within the Gupt Godavari caves, stromatolitic exposures at Janaki Kund, and the well-preserved sedimentary sequences of Kamadgiri and Sangrampur Hills. Altogether, the region provided a continuous geological record that spans from deep-time crystalline basement to Proterozoic sedimentation and modern surface modification.

# Tools & Methodology:
1. Field mapping using Brunton compass for measuring strike, dip, and joint orientation
2. GPS tracking for precise location mapping of outcrops
3. Hand lens and acid tests (HCl) for lithological and mineralogical identification
4. Sedimentary structure logging, including ripples, cross-bedding, laminations, stylolites, and stromatolitic textures
5. Stratigraphic profiling at Kamadgiri Hill and Sangrampur Hill to understand formation boundaries
6. Geomorphological observations of river incision, cave formation, and weathering patterns
7. Structural analysis through fracture mapping, fault indicators, and bedding attitudes
8. Petrological examination of granites, quartzites, limestones, and sandstones

# Key Findings:

The field excursion revealed that the Chitrakoot region exposes one of the most instructive sequences of the Vindhyan Basin. At the Ken River, granitic basement rocks displayed features such as exfoliation, quartz veins, block disintegration, and joint widening, demonstrating long-term physical and chemical weathering. The Gupt Godavari caves showcased dissolutional cavities, stylolites, cross-bedding, and speleothems, proving that Vindhyan limestones underwent significant diagenetic modification by groundwater flow. At Janaki Kund, stromatolite-bearing limestones provided exceptional evidence for ancient microbial activity, while the erosional channels carved by the Mandakini River illustrated the ongoing geomorphological processes that sculpt the terrain. Hanuman Dhara revealed a clear unconformity between Semri limestones and Kaimur sandstones, offering insight into depositional gaps and shifts in environmental energy. Finally, the hills at Kamadgiri and Sangrampur displayed a complete vertical transition from Bundelkhand Granite at the base to Vindhyan limestones and sandstones above, alongside quartz veins, dolomite-filled fractures, oolitic textures, quartzite rocks, and weathered feldspars transitioning to clays. This combination of exposures allowed a full reconstruction of the region's Proterozoic depositional environments, post-depositional changes, and modern weathering processes.

   b. River-induced erosional channels and smoothened rock surfaces

4. Hanuman Dhara

   b. Clear unconformity between limestone and sandstone
   c. Natural spring emergence linked to porous sandstone

5. Kamadgiri & Sangrampur Hills:
   a. Full Vindhyan sequence: Granite → Semri Limestone → Kaimur Sandstone
   b. Dolomite-filled fractures, quartz veins, oolitic limestone
   c. Quartzite indicating low-grade metamorphism

# Geological Significance:

The geological significance of the Chitrakoot area stems from its exceptional preservation of a continuous geological record from ancient crystalline basement to Proterozoic sedimentary successions. The nonconformity between Bundelkhand Granite and the overlying Semri Group marks a major event in the region’s geological history, highlighting a long period of erosion that preceded the onset of Vindhyan sedimentation. The Semri limestones and Kaimur sandstones preserve sedimentary structures that reflect fluctuating paleoenvironments ranging from shallow marine conditions to energetic fluvial systems. Stromatolites found at Janaki Kund offer rare evidence of early microbial ecosystems, revealing aspects of Earth’s biosphere during the Proterozoic. Structural features such as joint systems, fractures, and minor tilting indicate that, despite the Vindhyan Basin's overall stability, the region has experienced subtle tectonic influences tied to the nearby Narmada–Son Lineament. These geological insights make Chitrakoot an invaluable site for reconstructing early Earth environments, understanding tectonic evolution, and linking basement geology with sedimentary basin development.
